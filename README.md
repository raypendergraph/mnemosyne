# mnemosyne
mnemosyne aims to be semantic datasource and knowledge base. Maybe a cross between a mind map
and Evernote. Its goal is to capture and present related concepts attached to events or entries
such that it conveys concepts or events with all the other ancillary thoughts.

It's for software development or research journal but is really general purpose and can be used for many other things.
